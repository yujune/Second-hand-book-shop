	such as students, teachers and other potential users because we have not enough of money
	to reinvest our websites, not enough money to recruit employee, to rebuild our company,
	add more infrastructure in company, maintenance fees, salary and advertising. Everybody was 
	down at that time and we were at the rock bottom. Nobody can help us and we are facing serious
	fund and common company problems.<br/><br/>
	<b>2011</b><br/>
	</p><p class="indentClass">After struggling for almost one year, we recruit an experienced programmer aka the best programmer
	and IT analist in Malaysia to help us out of tight spot. He used whatever he knows and whatever
	he learnt in his entire life to rebuild our company websites. Even though our company was
	really bad in condition and nobody believes it can be rebuilt, he still did not want to give up
	on this company as he strongly believes that this second hand books selling company can bring 
	a strong impact for young generations.<br/><br/>
	<b>2013</b><br/></p><p class="indentClass">
	After 3 years of hardwork and determinations, we finally found out a way to rebuild our company.
	We turn our company into a global company which we are able to compete with other strong company
	like Facebook, Google, Mocrosoft as we want to grow bigger and larger. Firstly, we focus on the 
	TARUC students for almost 3 months.

	For the next year from 2014 which is 2015, we were facing another problem and since that year,
	we cannot make a revenue just like previous year did. The route have became more arduos and
	challenging because of financial crisis all around the world. The global market was down so 
	we were. The consumer and users have became lesser and lesser, finally we got lots of debt 
	from different bank because we cannot make enough money to cover it. We were broke at that time
	and nobody was willing to help us because they do not trust us can be last longer. Even thought
	we were looked down by others, but our crew seems to not give up that easily. We just kept do 
	what we can do and try our best to saved our company from falling to a deep endless dark hole.<br/><br/>
	<b>2016</b><br/></p><p class="indentClass">
	After one year of financial crisis, we finally made it out and learnt lots of knowledge and 
	gained multitude of experiences from our mistake. We started to cooperate with other company
	so we can build it more bigger and stronger to prevent next financial crisis in the world.
