	" I never thought that I could work in such a great company in my life. I have learnt a lot of 
	  extra knowledge and skills from my college and now I have become more and more knowlegable.
	  I really love the challenges that we have to face and solve for our company everyday because
	  it make us grow and become more and more stronger and tougher. I remembered the first time that
	  I came to this company for and interview, I was attracted and astonised by the attitude and deligence
	  of the employees that work here. They were so discipline and never thought about resting or compaining.
	  This is why I have worked here for almost 10 years and I never thought of changing company for my job.
	  If you are the one who have the same passion with me, please come over here for an interview or contact
	  my number! The doors are always open for you.

	" I was the people that have no dreams and target in my life. I always eat, sleep and repeat and do nothing
	  preparation for my future. But in the year of 2015, I was so lucky that I was introduced to work in this
	  company by my friend. Since the time that I worked in this company, finally, I have found what I want and 
	  my passion in my life. Be a assistant manager in this company is my honor. I was so proud to be here and
	  I really apreciate to those who never give up on me and they are really importance to my life. We have went
	  through lots of obstacle and we never even thought about give up.Never give up is what I always remember. 
	   have contributed my entire life, money and time into this company because I am strongly believe on it. 
	   If you are the one who have faced the same problem that I did, you must give you a chance to join us because 
	   you will never regret it.
